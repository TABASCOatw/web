## Objectives

By the end of this guide, you should be able to:

- Spin up Particle Connect project to generate an Externally-Owned-Account (EOA) via a social login
- Assign a Coinbase smart account to the EOA generated by Particle Connect
- Facilitate 2-click logins
- Construct and execute a gasless transaction

---

## Prerequisites

### Wallet funds

This guide requires you to have ETH on Base Sepolia, which will be used to showcase the execution of a gasless transfer transaction.

- To fund your wallet with ETH on Base Sepolia, visit one of the faucets listed on the [Base Faucets] page.

### Familiarity with modern, frontend web development

In this example, you'll be building a React-based application using Next JS and the `create-connectkit` CLI.

## Understanding Particle Network

### Wallet Abstraction

Particle Network provides a large suite of SDKs centered around the reduction of account-based friction.

In this case, "account-based friction" refers to barriers-to-entry that some Web3 users may face as they onboard into an application and begin managing a wallet.

This friction, in the context of this guide, can be placed within two distinct categories:

1. The login process. Often, decentralized applications that tend to be more consumer-facing prefer login flows that aren't dependent upon a user downloading and managing a traditional wallet, as this can be a pain point for some.
2. The rigidity of standard accounts. Externally Owned Accounts, or EOAs, are often quite rigid in how they operate. They're secured by one key and limited to a strict range of functions, thus developers (and therefore users) are confined to relatively low-level interaction with applications.

Wallet Abstraction based on Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) aims to solve the first of these two points, the login process. WaaS solutions provide an alternative to standard wallets, typically allowing users to use applications through accounts generated by social logins (such as Google, email, or phone). The interfaces for interacting with these accounts are also often embedded within the applications, resulting in a consistent, application-specific experience.

WaaS providers other than Particle Network include [Web3Auth], [Privy], and [Magic], among others.

### Account Abstraction

Particle Network also aims to tackle the second friction point described above: account flexibility.

Account Abstraction refers to a transition away from standard account structures, EOAs, to smart accounts. Smart accounts are contracts that act as a wallet, providing users with an account that feels equivalent to an EOA but is intrinsically programmable (due to it being a smart contract) and thus more flexible.

The most popular modern implementation of Account Abstraction is [ERC-4337], which enables Account Abstraction without any consensus-layer protocol changes. It does this through numerous components of supporting infrastructure, including a Bundler and Paymaster.

Particle Network describes its Account Abstraction stack as modular, referring to cross-compatibility with any provider of Bundlers, Paymasters, or smart accounts. Particle Network's Account Abstraction SDK runs and uses its own Bundler and Paymaster, with built-in support for [Biconomy]'s Paymaster. However, Particle has made it simple to plug into [external infrastructure and components], such as Paymasters or Bundlers from providers like Stackup or Pimlico.

#### Wallet Abstraction + Account Abstraction

Leveraging Account Abstraction directly with Wallet-as-a-Service enables users to onboard via social logins into embedded wallets that use smart accounts instead of EOAs, providing greater flexibility and user control.

Particle Connect combines these capabilities into a single SDK, simplifying the development process and enhancing the user experience.

## Integrating Particle Connect

Start by creating a [new Next JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) project.

The Particle Connect SDK simplifies wallet creation, user login, and interactions with Particle. It provides a unified interface for both social logins (via Particle Auth) and traditional Web3 wallets, ensuring an accessible experience for all users, whether familiar with Web3 or not.

### Install Dependencies

To get started, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2

OR

npm install @particle-network/connectkit viem@^2
```

### Configure Particle Connect

Once the dependencies are installed, go to the [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/login) to create a project and application. This step will provide you with essential keys (projectId, clientKey, and appId) needed for configuring Particle Connect.

Next, wrap your application with the `ParticleConnectkit` component. This allows you to input the project keys and customize the SDK settings.

Here’s an example `Connectkit.tsx` file (using Next.js) that exports the `ParticleConnectkit` component:

```ts
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import { ConnectKitProvider, createConfig } from '@particle-network/connectkit';
import { authWalletConnectors } from '@particle-network/connectkit/auth';
import { base, baseSepolia } from '@particle-network/connectkit/chains';

const config = createConfig({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,
  walletConnectors: [authWalletConnectors({})],

  plugins: [
    aa({
      name: 'COINBASE',
      version: '1.0.0',
    }),
  ],

  chains: [base, baseSepolia],
});

export const ParticleConnectkit = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
  return <ConnectKitProvider config={config}>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>;
};
```

:::info

This example provides a minimal version of the ConnectKit.tsx file to help you get started. For detailed configuration options and full implementation guidelines, refer to the [Particle Network documentation](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web#configuration).
:::

To integrate this into your app, wrap your application with the ParticleConnectkit component. Here's an example layout.tsx file:

```ts
import { ParticleConnectkit } from '@/connectkit';
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Particle Connectkit App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Enabling Login and Connection

After setting up Particle Connect, you can facilitate social logins in your application using the ConnectButton component.

```ts
import { ConnectButton, useAccount } from '@particle-network/connectkit';

export const App = () => {
  const { address, isConnected, chainId } = useAccount();

  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectButton />
      {isConnected && (
        <>
          <h2>Address: {address}</h2>
          <h2>Chain ID: {chainId}</h2>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

To manage interactions at the application level after onboarding, `@particle-network/connectkit` offers a variety of hooks. You can explore all [available hooks](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/connect/desktop/web#key-react-hooks-for-particle-connect) in the Particle Connect SDK documentation.

Here’s an improved version of the text with better structure, grammar corrections, and more clarity:

## Sending a Gasless Transaction

Particle Connect provides all the necessary infrastructure to send gasless transactions easily.

### Step 1: Create a Smart Account Instance

Begin by creating an instance of `smartAccount`. This will allow you to utilize the smart account as the signer for the transaction.

```ts
import { useSmartAccount } from '@particle-network/connectkit';

// Inside your app
const smartAccount = useSmartAccount();
```

### Step 2: Execute a Gasless Transaction

Once you have the `smartAccount` instance, you can create and send a gasless transaction by constructing a `userOp`. The example below shows how to transfer 0.01 ETH without the user paying gas fees.

```ts
const executeTxNative = async () => {
  const tx = {
    to: recipientAddress,
    value: parseEther('0.01').toString(),
    data: '0x',
  };

  // Fetch fee quotes and use verifyingPaymasterGasless for a gasless transaction
  const feeQuotesResult = await smartAccount?.getFeeQuotes(tx);
  const { userOp, userOpHash } = feeQuotesResult?.verifyingPaymasterGasless || {};

  if (userOp && userOpHash) {
    const txHash = await smartAccount?.sendUserOperation({ userOp, userOpHash });
    setTransactionHash(txHash);
    console.log('Transaction sent:', txHash);
  }
};
```

This function will send a gasless transfer of 0.01 ETH to the specified recipient address.
